    git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd task-management
    ```

3. Create the database:

    - For MySQL, import the `db.sql` file.
    - For SQLite, create an SQLite database file (`tasks.db`) and run the SQL commands from `db.sql`.

4. Update database configuration:

    - Open `src/Database.php` and modify the database connection details.

5. Start a PHP development server:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```

    Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. Create, update, and delete tasks on the dashboard.
3. Categorize tasks and set due dates for better organization.
4. Explore your user profile for task statistics.

## Database Setup

- For MySQL:

    ```sql
    -- Create users table
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create tasks table
    CREATE TABLE tasks (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        user_id INT,
        title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```

- For SQLite:

    ```sql
    -- Create users table
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        username TEXT NOT NULL,
        password TEXT NOT NULL
    );

    -- Create tasks table
    CREATE TABLE tasks (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INTEGER,
        title TEXT NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Before contributing, please review our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Let us put the below ideas for incorporating AI into this great task management web app:

Smart Task Prioritization:

Implement a recommendation system that analyzes user behavior, historical task completion data, and deadlines to suggest task priorities.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Enable users to add tasks using natural language. Implement NLP to extract key details and automatically populate task fields such as due date, priority, and category.
Automated Task Categorization:

Use machine learning models to automatically categorize tasks based on keywords, patterns, or user behavior. This can help users organize their tasks more efficiently.
Intelligent Reminders:

Implement an AI-driven reminder system that analyzes the user's behavior, workload, and deadlines to send timely reminders for upcoming tasks.
Predictive Analytics:

Leverage historical task data and user patterns to predict future workload and provide insights into potential bottlenecks or periods of high activity.
Collaborative Filtering:

Implement collaborative filtering to suggest tasks or projects that might be relevant to the user based on the preferences and activities of similar users.
Smart Scheduling:

Use AI algorithms to assist users in scheduling tasks by considering factors like optimal work times, estimated task duration, and existing commitments.
AI-Powered Insights:

Provide users with personalized insights and analytics, such as productivity trends, completion rates, and suggestions for improving task management habits.
Automated Documentation:

Use AI to automatically document completed tasks, including key details and insights. This can serve as a digital journal for users to reflect on their accomplishments.
Voice-Activated Commands:

Implement voice recognition and commands for hands-free task management. Users can add, update, or complete tasks using voice prompts.
Sentiment Analysis:

Integrate sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of task descriptions or comments. This can help users identify stressful or high-priority tasks.
Adaptive User Interface:

Create an adaptive UI that learns from user interactions and adjusts the layout or features to better suit individual preferences and work styles.
